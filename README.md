### Hi, I'm Anandhraman (toymakerftw) 👋

I'm a **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)** by day and a **creator** and **tinkerer** by night. I’m passionate about building innovative tools, solving complex problems, and contributing to projects that make an impact.

----------

### 🔧 **Projects**

Here are some of the tools and utilities I’ve developed:

-   **[ServerSage](https://github.com/Toymakerftw/ServerSage)**  
    A modern server and network monitoring utility designed to keep you informed with real-time updates.
    
-   **[Triage-IDS](https://github.com/Toymakerftw/Triage-IDS)**  
    A robust firewall and router solution that adds an extra layer of security to your network.
    
-   **[Wallpaper Manager](https://github.com/Toymakerftw/Wallpaper)**  
    Automatically update your desktop wallpaper from GitHub releases—perfect for a fresh look every day.
    
-   **[Recycler](https://github.com/Toymakerftw/Recycler)**  
    A Go-based CLI tool for managing your trash, inspired by `trash-cli`, but with additional features to improve workflow efficiency.
